                    Let me introduce myself, Claire Barnaby. Unfortunately I am not the queen of anything just a common
                    software engineer. Officially in my career I develop web apps that scale and add value. This one is
                    built with react and the new, as of 2024, nextjs app router. But really I facilitate human computer
                    interaction by building software to make our life easier and more fun. Which really means I use my 5
                    years of experience to collaborate with product and design to solve problems.
